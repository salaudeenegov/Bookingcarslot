ParkingWalla is a simple vehicle parking management system built with **React**.  
It is designed to help restaurants or small businesses manage their parking slots, staff, and visitors efficiently.  
All parking and vehicle data are stored locally using IndexedDB.

Each role has clear access and actions, so parking operations run smoothly with real-time logs and daily parking counts.
